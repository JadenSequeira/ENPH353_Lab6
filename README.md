ENPH 353 Lab 7 - Jaden Sequeira

In regards to the lab question on state space complexity, the state space being used is of decent size but is complexity is quite weak. Adding more vertical columns or reducing vertical columns significantly, can lead to slower training. However, increasing the complexity, such as adding a horizontal divider to divide the state space. This can help with control based off of future line prediction - leading to potentially better training.
